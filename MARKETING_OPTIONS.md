# Arcana Marketing Strategy - 5 Press Release Options

## Option 1: "Stripe for Agentic Commerce" (Infrastructure Play)

### Headline
**Arcana Launches Universal Adapter for Agentic Commerce, Enabling Merchants to Accept AI Agent Transactions Across All Platforms**

### Subhead
One integration replaces months of per-platform development work as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude-powered agents prepare to transform holiday shopping

### Lede
San Francisco, CA - Arcana today announced the launch of its agentic commerce middleware platform, enabling any merchant to accept transactions from AI agents across ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and other platforms with a single 10-minute integration. The move comes as major tech companies race to launch agent-powered shopping experiences ahead of the 2025 holiday season.

### Key Points
- **Target Audience:** E-commerce platforms, SaaS companies, payment processors
- **Value Prop:** "Stripe didn't make you build Visa, Mastercard, Amex separately. We don't make you build ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude separately."
- **Hook:** Infrastructure layer that everyone needs
- **Call to Action:** "Become agent-ready in 10 minutes"

### Quote from Founder
"Right now, every merchant who wants to support agentic commerce faces 9-13 weeks of engineering work per platform. That's unsustainable. We're building the universal adapter layer so merchants can focus on their business, not protocol integration."

### Supporting Stats
- 4 major agentic commerce protocols launched in 2025
- $90k-$130k average integration cost per protocol
- 200+ million active ChatGPT users expected by Q4 2025

## Option 2: "Returns Intelligence" (Vertical-Specific Play)

### Headline
**Arcana Solves the $817B Returns Crisis with AI-Powered Agent Authentication for E-commerce**

### Subhead
New platform combines fraud detection, policy automation, and agent verification to help merchants approve legitimate returns while blocking sophisticated AI-driven fraud

### Lede
San Francisco, CA - As AI agents begin handling customer service interactions, Arcana today launched the first returns management platform designed specifically for the agentic commerce era. The system verifies agent identities, automates policy enforcement, and provides audit-grade logging to help merchants navigate the intersection of autonomous agents and returns fraud.

### Key Points
- **Target Audience:** E-commerce merchants, fraud prevention teams, CFOs
- **Value Prop:** "Returns are already your biggest problem. AI agents make it worse without the right infrastructure."
- **Hook:** Solves specific, painful problem (returns fraud + complexity)
- **Call to Action:** "Reduce return fraud by 40% while approving good customers faster"

### Quote from Founder
"Returns cost merchants $817 billion annually, and fraud accounts for 10-15% of that. As AI agents start initiating returns on behalf of customers, merchants need to verify: Is this agent legitimate? Is this customer real? Our platform provides that verification layer while automating policy enforcement."

### Supporting Stats
- $817B in annual e-commerce returns (2024)
- 10.4% average return rate across e-commerce

## Option 3: "Platform Growth Enabler" (B2B2C Play)

### Subhead
New merchant onboarding platform lets AI platforms add thousands of commerce partners without building BD teams

### Lede
San Francisco, CA - Arcana today announced partnerships with leading AI platforms to streamline merchant onboarding for agentic commerce. Instead of each platform hiring business development teams to onboard merchants one-by-one, platforms can integrate Arcana once and gain access to an entire network of agent-ready merchants.

### Key Points
- **Target Audience:** AI platforms (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), payment processors
- **Value Prop:** "Stop hiring BD. Start shipping merchant integrations."
- **Hook:** Network effects - platforms need merchants, merchants need platforms
- **Call to Action:** "Launch with 500+ merchants in 30 days, not 18 months"

### Quote from Founder
"OpenAI, Google, Stripe - they're all facing the same bottleneck: merchant adoption. Every platform is building their own integration docs, SDKs, and support teams. We give them an instant merchant network so they can focus on their core product."

### Supporting Stats
- Average time to onboard 100 merchants: 12-18 months per platform
- Estimated BD cost: $200k-$500k per platform per quarter

### Subhead
Universal commerce protocol lets ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude agents transact at any merchant without per-platform credentials

### Lede
San Francisco, CA - Arcana today launched a universal commerce protocol that enables AI agents to transact at any participating merchant, regardless of which platform the agent runs on. The move addresses growing concerns about platform lock-in as major tech companies compete to control agentic commerce.

### Key Points

- **Value Prop:** "One agent, every merchant. No platform lock-in."
- **Hook:** Consumer choice & interoperability (like email, web browsers)
- **Call to Action:** "Build agents that work everywhere"

### Quote from Founder
"We're seeing each platform try to create closed ecosystems - only ChatGPT agents can shop at OpenAI merchants, only Gemini at Google merchants. That's bad for consumers and bad for innovation. We're building the open protocol layer so any agent can shop anywhere."

### Supporting Stats
- 78% of consumers want to use multiple AI assistants
- Estimated 1M+ custom AI agents by end of 2025
