## üî∂ Manual Tasks Required (You Must Do These)

### Priority 1: Monitoring Setup (30 minutes)

#### A. UptimeRobot (Recommended - Free)
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com
2. Create free account
3. Add monitor:
   - **Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **URL:** `https://arcana-returns-api.fly.dev/health`
   - **Name:** Arcana Returns API
   - **Interval:** 5 minutes
   - **Alert Contacts:** Your email
4. Test alert by temporarily stopping the app

#### B. Fly.io Alerts
```bash
# Set up crash alerts
fly alerts create \
  --check health \
  --threshold 2 \
  --email your-email@example.com

# List configured alerts
fly alerts list
```

**Why:** You need to know immediately if the system goes down.

---

### Priority 2: Backup Infrastructure (1-2 hours)

#### A. Create AWS S3 Bucket (or Backblaze B2)

**Option 1: AWS S3 (Standard)**
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
2. Create bucket: `arcana-returns-backups`
3. Region: `us-west-2` (or closest to Fly.io)
4. Enable versioning
5. Create IAM user with S3 write access
6. Save access key + secret key

**Option 2: Backblaze B2 (Cheaper)**
1. Go to https://www.backblaze.com/b2
2. Create bucket: `arcana-returns-backups`
3. Generate application key
4. Cost: ~$0.005/GB vs AWS $0.023/GB

#### B. Configure Fly.io Secrets
```bash
# Set AWS credentials
fly secrets set \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-here \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key-here \
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2 \
  BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=s3://arcana-returns-backups
```

#### C. Test Backup Manually
```bash
# SSH into Fly.io
fly ssh console

# Run backup script
cd /app
./scripts/backup-db.sh

# Verify uploaded
aws s3 ls s3://arcana-returns-backups/
```

#### D. Schedule Daily Backups
Add to your Dockerfile or create a cron job:
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs at 2am UTC daily)
0 2 * * * /app/scripts/backup-db.sh
```

**Why:** Backups are your disaster recovery plan. Test them before you need them.

---

### Priority 3: Generate Pilot Credentials (30 minutes)

#### A. Generate API Key
```bash
# SSH into Fly.io
fly ssh console

# Generate key for first pilot merchant
cd /app
node dist/cli/index.js keys generate \
  --merchant pilot_merchant_001 \
  --name "Pilot Merchant #1"

# Output will be:
# API Key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Merchant ID: pilot_merchant_001
```

**Save this securely!** Store in 1Password or similar:
- Title: "Arcana Pilot - Merchant 001"
- API Key: sk_xxxxx
- Merchant ID: pilot_merchant_001
- Created: [date]

#### B. Import Default Policy
```bash
# Still in fly ssh console
node dist/cli/index.js policy import \
  --merchant pilot_merchant_001 \
  --text "Returns accepted within 30 days of purchase. Items must be in original packaging with tags attached. Free returns via prepaid label. No restocking fee for standard items. Electronics have 14-day window. Photo of packaging required for all returns."

# Output will be:
# Policy ID: plc_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Save this too:**
- Policy ID: plc_xxxxx
- Merchant: pilot_merchant_001

---

### Priority 4: End-to-End Test (15 minutes)

Run through the complete flow yourself:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export API_KEY="sk_xxxxx"  # From step above
export POLICY_ID="plc_xxxxx"  # From step above
export API_URL="https://arcana-returns-api.fly.dev"

# 1. Health check
curl $API_URL/health

# 2. Issue token
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST $API_URL/returns/token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"order_id\": \"test_$(date +%s)\",
    \"customer_ref\": \"test_customer\",
    \"items\": [{\"sku\": \"TEST-SKU\", \"qty\": 1, \"price_cents\": 2999}],
    \"reason_code\": \"doesnt_fit\",
    \"policy_id\": \"$POLICY_ID\"
  }")

echo $RESPONSE | jq '.'

# Extract return token
RETURN_TOKEN=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.return_token')

# 3. Authorize
curl -X POST $API_URL/returns/authorize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"return_token\": \"$RETURN_TOKEN\",
    \"evidence\": [{
      \"type\": \"photo_packaging\",
      \"url\": \"https://picsum.photos/800/600\"
    }]
  }" | jq '.'

# 4. Commit
curl -X POST $API_URL/returns/commit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"return_token\": \"$RETURN_TOKEN\",
    \"receipt_event\": {
      \"type\": \"scan\",
      \"carrier\": \"UPS\",
      \"ts\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"
    }
  }" | jq '.'
```

**Expected Results:**
- All commands return 200 OK
- No errors in logs
- Decision is "approve"
- Refund instruction is "instant"
