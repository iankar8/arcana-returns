## ðŸ”¶ What You Need to Do Next (Manual Steps)

### Priority 1: Set Up Monitoring (30 min) ðŸš¨

**Option A: UptimeRobot (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Add monitor for `https://arcana-returns-api.fly.dev/health`
4. Set interval to 5 minutes
5. Add your email for alerts

**Option B: Fly.io Alerts**
```bash
fly alerts create --check health --threshold 2 --email your@email.com
```

**Why This Matters:** You'll be notified immediately if the system goes down.

---

### Priority 2: Set Up Backups (1-2 hours) ðŸ’¾

#### Step 1: Create S3 Bucket
**AWS S3:**
- Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
- Create bucket: `arcana-returns-backups`
- Region: us-west-2
- Enable versioning

**OR Backblaze B2 (cheaper):**
- Go to https://www.backblaze.com/b2
- Create bucket: `arcana-returns-backups`

#### Step 2: Configure Credentials
```bash
fly secrets set \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret \
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2 \
  BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=s3://arcana-returns-backups
```

#### Step 3: Test Backup
```bash
fly ssh console
cd /app
./scripts/backup-db.sh
```

#### Step 4: Schedule Daily Backups
The script is ready, you just need to add a cron job (or run manually daily for now).

**Why This Matters:** This is your disaster recovery plan. You can restore any point in time.

---

### Priority 3: Generate Pilot Credentials (30 min) ðŸ”‘

```bash
# SSH into Fly.io
fly ssh console

# Generate API key
cd /app
node dist/cli/index.js keys generate \
  --merchant pilot_merchant_001 \
  --name "First Pilot Merchant"

# You'll get something like:
# API Key: sk_abc123def456...
# Merchant ID: pilot_merchant_001

# Import policy
node dist/cli/index.js policy import \
  --merchant pilot_merchant_001 \
  --text "30 day returns, no restocking fee, photo required"

# You'll get:
# Policy ID: plc_xyz789...
```

**Save these securely:**
- API Key: `sk_...`
- Policy ID: `plc_...`
- Merchant ID: `pilot_merchant_001`

Store in 1Password or secure note manager.

**Why This Matters:** These are the credentials you'll give to your pilot merchant.

---

### Priority 4: Test Everything (15 min) âœ…

Run the complete flow to verify:

```bash
# Set your credentials
export API_KEY="sk_your_key_here"
export POLICY_ID="plc_your_policy_here"
export API_URL="https://arcana-returns-api.fly.dev"

# Test health
curl $API_URL/health

# Issue token
curl -X POST $API_URL/returns/token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "test_001",
    "customer_ref": "test",
    "items": [{"sku": "TEST", "qty": 1, "price_cents": 2999}],
    "reason_code": "doesnt_fit",
    "policy_id": "'$POLICY_ID'"
  }'

# Should return a return_token
# Then test authorize and commit (see PILOT_ONBOARDING.md)
```

**Why This Matters:** Verify everything works before giving credentials to a merchant.
